abstract = {Nowadays, there is a growing need for flying drones with diverse capabilities for both civilian and military applications. There is also a significant interest in the development of novel drones which can autonomously fly in different environments and locations and can perform various missions. In the past decade, the broad spectrum of applications of these drones has received most attention which led to the invention of various types of drones with different sizes and weights. In this review paper, we identify a novel classification of flying drones that ranges from unmanned air vehicles to smart dusts at both ends of this spectrum, with their new defined applications. Design and fabrication challenges of micro drones, existing methods for increasing their endurance, and various navigation and control approaches are discussed in details. Limitations of the existing drones, proposed solutions for the next generation of drones, and recommendations are also presented and discussed.}

abstract="Developing and testing algorithms for autonomous vehicles in real world is an expensive and time consuming process. Also, in order to utilize recent advances in machine intelligence and deep learning we need to collect a large amount of annotated training data in a variety of conditions and environments. We present a new simulator built on Unreal Engine that offers physically and visually realistic simulations for both of these goals. Our simulator includes a physics engine that can operate at a high frequency for real-time hardware-in-the-loop (HITL) simulations with support for popular protocols (e.g. MavLink). The simulator is designed from the ground up to be extensible to accommodate new types of vehicles, hardware platforms and software protocols. In addition, the modular design enables various components to be easily usable independently in other projects. We demonstrate the simulator by first implementing a quadrotor as an autonomous vehicle and then experimentally comparing the software components with real-world flights.",

ABSTRACT = {With the upsurge in use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), drone detection and pose estimation by using optical sensors becomes an important research subject in cooperative flight and low-altitude security. The existing technology only obtains the position of the target UAV based on object detection methods. To achieve better adaptability and enhanced cooperative performance, the attitude information of the target drone becomes a key message to understand its state and intention, e.g., the acceleration of quadrotors. At present, most of the object 6D pose estimation algorithms depend on accurate pose annotation or a 3D target model, which costs a lot of human resource and is difficult to apply to non-cooperative targets. To overcome these problems, a quadrotor 6D pose estimation algorithm was proposed in this paper. It was based on keypoints detection (only need keypoints annotation), relational graph network and perspective-n-point (PnP) algorithm, which achieves state-of-the-art performance both in simulation and real scenario. In addition, the inference ability of our relational graph network to the keypoints of four motors was also evaluated. The accuracy and speed were improved significantly compared with the state-of-the-art keypoints detection algorithm.},

  abstract={Nowadays, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are widely deployed in many contexts (civilian and military). Real experiments using UAVs are costly; therefore, the performances of UAVs systems should be analyzed before their deployments. Accordingly, researchers and software engineers developed several simulations tools, environments and frameworks for UAV systems evaluation. In this context, this study highlights and identifies the most suitable simulators for UAVs flights and UAVs managements. This paper details the requirements, the goals, the strengths and the weakness of each studied tools. This investigation helps researchers to identify and to select the adequate UAVs performances analysis tools that satisfy their needs.},

  abstract={Photovoltaic systems as part of larger distribution systems for the production of electricity have non-linear current-voltage characteristics. These characteristics depend on the temperature of the solar cells and insulation of panels. The method for the search of the maximum power or MPPT is widely known, and there are many offered algorithm solutions. The aim of this paper is to present ANFIS (Adaptive Neural Fuzzy System Inference) as a method of computer intelligence in the search function of maximum power or maximum utilization of the PV system, without prior knowledge of the system. MPPT ANFIS will be located between the PV panels and devices for voltage regulation. Inputs used to go inside the fuzzy regulators and outputs of the fuzzy regulators are going into power changing device. The advantage of this method is the low cost of implementation because it uses embedded computer systems and does not require additional sensors for measuring temperature and insolation. It is very easy to upgrade in the case of increasing the knowledge base used in FIS membership function. Everything is simulated by MATLAB/Simulink software on the one-phase IBC system.},

abstract = {So called fuzzy control has been developed for the purpose of realization of a man-like controller with the aid of computer. However, most of fuzzy controllers have two very important problems. First is a defect of the reasoning algorithm. Second is a way to acquire control rules, particulaly the precise parameters in the rules. In this Daper considering the above problems, we propose a realistic fuzzy reasoning algorithm and a method to identify control rules from human operators actual control actions. Further we examine the performance of the proposed algorithm by applying it to water cleaning process control.}

    abstract = { This paper presents visual-inertial datasets collected on-board a micro aerial vehicle. The datasets contain synchronized stereo images, IMU measurements and accurate ground truth. The first batch of datasets facilitates the design and evaluation of visual-inertial localization algorithms on real flight data. It was collected in an industrial environment and contains millimeter accurate position ground truth from a laser tracking system. The second batch of datasets is aimed at precise 3D environment reconstruction and was recorded in a room equipped with a motion capture system. The datasets contain 6D pose ground truth and a detailed 3D scan of the environment. Eleven datasets are provided in total, ranging from slow flights under good visual conditions to dynamic flights with motion blur and poor illumination, enabling researchers to thoroughly test and evaluate their algorithms. All datasets contain raw sensor measurements, spatio-temporally aligned sensor data and ground truth, extrinsic and intrinsic calibrations and datasets for custom calibrations. }

abstract = {This review concentrates on three main challenges of controlling a quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) as an underactuated mechanical system (UMS). The challenges include underactuation, model uncertainty, and actuator failure. The review also illustrates the state of the quadrotor control research in an attempt to find practical solutions for those challenges. By definition, a UMS has less number of control actions than the number of degrees of freedom to be controlled. Hence, traditional control strategies developed for fully actuated systems are not directly applicable to UMS. Research on UMS is one of the most interesting topics in the robotics and control community because of its relevance to a variety of applications. Examples include humanoid robots and most aerial and underwater vehicles. However similar to any other nonlinear systems, the stability and control of quadrotors suffer from intrinsic complexities exasperated by underactuation, model uncertainties and actuator failure. In this review article, we are going to address these problems and discuss the solutions mostly concerning the application of different control strategies presented in recent literature. We also present the frontiers and research directions towards improving performance of quadrotors for emerging and complex applications.}
